# Numerical approximation uses five ways to calculate the f(x)=exp(x) integraled over [-1,1]
# SparseMatrix prints out the sparse matrix represented by three array
# vectorProduct computes the product of two matrices

#numerial approximation and sparsematrix runs under windows 10 with DevC++.
#vectorProduct runs under macOS with XCode.
